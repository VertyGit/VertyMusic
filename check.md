Hi

This is the first time we can share with each other using this simple tool. We can do this because this company developed this tool and it is free for all users. It's very interesting what the business model of this company is. However, the company was acquired by MS. In MS, this product is small, but it provides all the code details public and private. It is also connected to all developments in the world. MS can use this information to predict the future of IT. Direct contacts can also be provided for development and direction of IT.
